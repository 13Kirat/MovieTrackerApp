Cinemas App
This project is a React Native application that provides information about movies and shows, including a pull-to-refresh feature, search functionality, sorting, filtering, and layout toggle (grid/list view).

Features
Search: Search movies and shows by title.
Sort: Sort the list alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A).
Filter: Filter content by type (Movies or Shows).
Toggle View: Switch between grid and list layouts.
Pull to Refresh: Refresh the data with a pull-down gesture.
Navigation: Navigate to detailed pages for movies and shows.
Hamburger Menu and Profile: Interactive header buttons.
Assumptions
Data Source:

Movies and shows data is fetched from a mock API function fetchMoviesAndShows located in the ../api/moviesApi file.
Each item in the dataset includes fields like:
id: Unique identifier for the movie/show.
title: Title of the movie/show.
type: Indicates whether it's a movie or show.
poster_url: URL for the poster image.
Description: Brief description of the movie/show.
Dependencies:

This project uses the react-native framework.
Icons are provided by @expo/vector-icons.
Navigation:

The app assumes React Navigation is properly configured.
Two navigation routes are required:
HomeScreen: This is the main screen.
MovieDetails: Displays detailed information about a movie or show.
UI Components:

Pull-to-refresh functionality uses FlatListâ€™s native onRefresh and refreshing props.
Grid and list layouts dynamically change based on the isGrid state.
