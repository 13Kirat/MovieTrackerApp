# Cinemas App

This project is a React Native application that provides information about movies and shows, including a pull-to-refresh feature, search functionality, sorting, filtering, and layout toggle (grid/list view).

---

## Features

- **Search:** Search movies and shows by title.
- **Sort:** Sort the list alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A).
- **Filter:** Filter content by type (Movies or Shows).
- **Toggle View:** Switch between grid and list layouts.
- **Pull to Refresh:** Refresh the data with a pull-down gesture.
- **Navigation:** Navigate to detailed pages for movies and shows.
- **Hamburger Menu and Profile:** Interactive header buttons.

---

## Assumptions

1. **Data Source:**
   - Movies and shows data is fetched from a mock API function `fetchMoviesAndShows` located in the `../api/moviesApi` file.
   - Each item in the dataset includes the following fields:
     - `id`: Unique identifier for the movie/show.
     - `title`: Title of the movie/show.
     - `type`: Indicates whether it's a `movie` or `show`.
     - `poster_url`: URL for the poster image.
     - `Description`: Brief description of the movie/show.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - This project uses the `react-native` framework.
   - Icons are provided by `@expo/vector-icons`.

3. **Navigation:**
   - The app assumes React Navigation is properly configured.
   - Two navigation routes are required:
     - **HomeScreen:** This is the main screen.
     - **MovieDetails:** Displays detailed information about a movie or show.

4. **UI Components:**
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality uses `FlatList`â€™s native `onRefresh` and `refreshing` props.
   - Grid and list layouts dynamically change based on the `isGrid` state.
